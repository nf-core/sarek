  Apply a score cutoff to filter variants based on a recalibration table.
  AplyVQSR performs the second pass in a two-stage process called Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR).
  Specifically, it applies filtering to the input variants based on the recalibration table produced
  in the first step by VariantRecalibrator and a target sensitivity value.

        Developed in the Data Sciences Platform at the Broad Institute, the toolkit offers a wide variety of tools
        with a primary focus on variant discovery and genotyping. Its powerful processing engine
        and high-performance computing features make it capable of taking on projects of any size.
