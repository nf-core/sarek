  Apply a score cutoff to filter variants based on a recalibration table.
  Sentieon's Aplyvarcal performs the second pass in a two-stage process called Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR).
  Specifically, it applies filtering to the input variants based on the recalibration table produced
  in the previous step VarCal and a target sensitivity value.
