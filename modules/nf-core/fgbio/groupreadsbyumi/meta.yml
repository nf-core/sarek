  Groups reads together that appear to have come from the same original molecule.
  Reads are grouped by template, and then templates are sorted by the 5â€™ mapping positions
  of the reads from the template, used from earliest mapping position to latest.
  Reads that have the same end positions are then sub-grouped by UMI sequence.
  (!) Note: the MQ tag is required on reads with mapped mates (!)
  This can be added using samblaster with the optional argument --addMateTags.
