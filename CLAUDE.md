# nf-core/sarek

Read `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDELINES.md` before making any changes.

## Agent-specific rules

- Keep branches **local** — do NOT push unless explicitly asked
- Do not amend commits without asking
- **Don't ask for confirmation** on routine git operations (creating branches, committing) — just do it following the conventions in the guidelines
- Use `nf-core` tools from the conda environment (`conda activate nf-core`)
