See `--nucleotides_per_second` on how to customize this.\nActual figures vary from 2 nucleotides/second to 30000 nucleotides/second.\nIf you prefer, you can specify the full path to your reference genome when you run the pipeline:\n\n> **NB** If none provided, will be generated automatically from the FASTA reference\n> **NB** Use --no_intervals to disable automatic generation.\n\n**Targeted Sequencing:**\n\nThe recommended flow for targeted sequencing data is to use the workflow as it is, but also provide a `BED` file containing targets for all steps using the `--intervals` option. In addition, the parameter `--wes` should be set.\nIt is advised to pad the variant calling regions (exons or target) to some extent before submitting to the workflow.\n\nThe procedure is similar to whole genome sequencing, except that only BED file are accepted. See above for formatting description.\nAdding every exon as an interval in case of `WES` can generate >200K processes or jobs, much more forks, and similar number of directories in the Nextflow work directory. These are appropriately  grouped together to reduce number of processes run in parallel (see above and `--nucleotides_per_second` for details). \nFurthermore, primers and/or baits are not 100% specific, (certainly not for MHC and KIR, etc.), quite likely there going to be reads mapping to multiple locations.\nIf you are certain that the target is unique for your genome (all the reads will certainly map to only one location), and aligning to the whole genome is an overkill, it is actually better to change the reference itself.",
