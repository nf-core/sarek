# Disclaimer

This `utils_references/` folder contains for now two functions and a schema.
This is really meant for a POC and should not be installed by anyone except @maxulysse.
But that was the easiest way to share functions and a schema between three different pipelines and still showcase the logic.
This might evolve in the future, possibly towards a proper plugin.

If you do so, please be aware that:

- @maxulysse has hacked the `main.nf` to test the functions and the schema
- This is really meant to evolve in the future and can be deleted at any moment without prior notice.

That being said, if you still want to use it or want to know more about it, please check the `#references` channel on the nf-core slack.
